Using the Riot Games API and Ruby on Rails, I developed a League of Legends RPG.

I consider this to be my first web development project and definitely my biggest in terms of the amount of Ruby, HTML and CSS that I learned while building it.

After completing the [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) from cover to cover 3 times, I decided to try and make my own rails application.

I decided to make a site where users could sign in and build a team of 5 champions and face off on Summoner's Rift. The outcome of the matches would be determined by champions' statistics, levels and items equipped.

Architecting out this MVC was probably my favourite part of the project (Figuring out associations, route  endpoints etc...) although looking back now, there was a lot of weird stuff I did. I hadn't yet learned javascript at the time and so all of the pages were static HTML but I did get to play around with the Bootstrap CSS framework. Nevertheless, it was a fun learning experience and it was a great way to apply what I learned from the different Rails guides.
