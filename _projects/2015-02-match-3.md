Multiplayer real-time matching Game. Winner of the 2015 Kik Hackathon.

During the winter term, Kik held a hackathon at the SLC. There was no theme, however we still decided to use Kik's API for user login. The game was actually inspired from a "Death Match" from the Korean game show [The Genius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YrvgdPdJ5U#t=34m43s) In the game, you are shown a 3x3 grid. In each tile, there is a shape, a shape color and a background color. Players must select 3 tiles where the 3 properties are all the same or all different. When you get a valid match, you get a point. There is also a "No More Moves" button which you press when you think that all of the correct matches have been found. Correctly pressing this button grants you 2 points but you lose 1 point if you incorrectly press it.


Personally, I'm pretty terrible at this game. Some of those valid patterns are pretty tough to spot. However the difficulty is what made it a hit at the hackathon. Word got around about our game during the hack and lots of other hackers and volunteers ended up playing it while taking a break. Since we kept hearing phrases like "Dammit, it's already taken!" and "Who got that one?", we added features such as showing the Kik profile picture of the user who beat you to the guess to increase competition.
