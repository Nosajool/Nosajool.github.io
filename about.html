    <p>
      This site is being used to push myself to learn new things and to test my understanding of concepts by explaining it to an audience in short posts.

    The 'blogging' writing style is different than the one I would use at my day job but it is one that I would like to get better at. I am a big fan of a few engineering blogs and it is fascinating to watch the author's careers and how they are growing. One of my favourites to read is <a href="https://jvns.ca">Julia Evan's blog</a> I had seen her give a talk back at <a href="http://2016.cusec.net">CUSEC 2016</a> and have been reading her blog ever since.
    </p>
    <p>For this blog, I'd like to copy her <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/20/blogging-principles">blogging tenants</a>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be honest about what I know </li>
      <li>Try not to write anything (too) wrong</li>
      <li>Be positive</li>
      <li>Write for a past version of myself</li>
      <li>Stick to my own experience</li>
      <li>Talk about what I've learned recently</li>
      <li>Remember: If not everyone likes it, that's ok</li>
    </ul>
