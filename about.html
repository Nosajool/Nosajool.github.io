    <h2>"Jason! Why is this site so plain?"</h2>
    <p>My <a href="https://github.com/Nosajool/old-site">old site</a> was definitely a lot funkier than the current one with cool animations but I found that it didn't look that great if you actually wanted to read what was there. I changed the layout to make it easier to read my posts. Past posts can be found <a href="https://github.com/Nosajool/Nosajool.github.io/tree/master/_posts">here</a> if they are not currently published.</p>

    <h2>Board Games</h2>
    My friends and I play a lot of board games in our free time. Here's a bunch that I enjoy.
    <button id="games-list-button" type="button" onclick="gamesListToggle()">Show List</button>
    <ul id="games-list">
      {% for game in site.data.boardgames %}
        <li>{{ game }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
