    <h1>About</h1>
    {{ site.description }}
    <p>My technical experience so far has been in web development with Ruby on Rails. Throughout university, I've completed internships at Shopify, Vidyard and Kik.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm interested in learning about ways to improve web performance at the different layers of an application as well as how distributed systems are used for Big Data analysis.</p>

    <p>I've also recently become more curious about finance and am taking a course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-investing">Computational Investing</a> on Coursera. </p>

    <h2>Board Games</h2>
    My friends and I play a lot of board games in our free time. Here's a bunch that I enjoy.
    <button id="games-list-button" type="button" onclick="gamesListToggle()">Show List</button>
    <ul id="games-list">
      {% for game in site.data.boardgames %}
        <li>{{ game }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
