title: Senators Playoff Run

2015 will be a season that Ottawa Senators fans will remember for a long time. Back in February, the Sens were sitting 14 points out of a playoff spot with 29 games remaining in the season. According to [sportsclubstats](http://www.sportsclubstats.com/NHL.html), they had a 2% chance of making the playoffs. Then came crushing injuries to both of our goalies, Craig Anderson and Robin Lehner which left us with one of the worst goalies in the AHL, Andrew Hammond.

Everyone thought that the Senator's season was over. At one point, they were sitting in 25th in the NHL. Then out of nowhere, Hammond came in and won game after game after game. He went a ridiculous 15 games without a regulation loss and brought life to the city. That 1 humilating loss to the first place New York Rangers didn't phase the Senators as they completed the Cinderella run finishing with a 23-3-3 record and finishing in 7th place in the East.

Ultimately, the Sens lost their first round series in 6 close games to the Montreal Canadiens but it's something we fans won't stay bitter about for very long. The key difference between this run and the one in 2013 is that back then, the veterans of the team were the ones that got us into the playoffs. This time, we were carried by an amazing young core that will be here for the next few years.

The future is bright for the Ottawa Senators.
